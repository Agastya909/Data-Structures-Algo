## C++ implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

### Linked List
       1. Singly Linked List
              1.1 Add node 
              1.2 Add node at n position
              1.3 Delete node
              1.4 Delete node from n position
              1.5 Reverse the list iteratively and recusively
              1.5 Print the list in both ways.
 ### BST 
       * Print Inorder, Preorder and Postorder traversal
       * Print Maximum and minimum element of the tree
