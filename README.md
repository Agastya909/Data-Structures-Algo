### [Linked List](https://github.com/Agastya909/Data-Structures-Algo/tree/main/linkedList)

       1. Singly Linked List
              1.1 Add node.
              1.2 Add node at n position.
              1.3 Delete node.
              1.4 Delete node from n position.
              1.5 Reverse the list iteratively and recursively.
              1.6 Print the list in both ways.

       2. Doubly Linked List
